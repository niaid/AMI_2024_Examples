## Description

This is a set of code examples that were part of a presentation to the Association of Medical Illustrators Conference in 2024.

The scripts provided are part of a workflow developed for converting a directory of medical imaging files (in formats such as DCM, NRRD, NII) into GLB files. These files have all organs segmented using the Total Segmentator tool, facilitating advanced medical visualization and analysis.
